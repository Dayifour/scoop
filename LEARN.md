## üöÄ Project Overview

**Scoop** is a PHP/MySQL marketplace that connects buyers and sellers directly via WhatsApp, without the need for a shopping cart. It‚Äôs designed to be simple, user-friendly, and efficient.

Key Features:
- **Product showcase**: Display products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **WhatsApp integration**: Sellers and buyers can contact each other directly via WhatsApp.
- **Admin panel**: Manage products, listings, and updates.
- **Search**: Users can search for products by category or keyword.

## üìñ How It Works

1. **Frontend**:
   - The website showcases products with images, descriptions, and prices.
   - The "WhatsApp" button allows users to contact the seller directly, bypassing the need for a cart system.

2. **Backend**:
   - Written in **PHP** and **MySQL**, the backend handles product listings and user interactions.
   - The database (`scoopbd`) stores product data, and admins can update listings through the admin panel.

3. **Database**:
   - The database file `scoopbd.sql` is provided in the root directory.
   - It includes tables for managing product information and user data (if needed).
